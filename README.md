I have started learning how to DJ recently. Quite fun!

One of the main challenges is of course figuring out which songs can be mixed with which. Because Im lazy + know how to code I figured I could feed a package a list of songs to generate a graph of which ones go together best.

I tried using spotipy, but it seems they have closed off their Song analysis API (lame!), so I will try https://getsongkey.com/ next (thanks a lot, really appreciate it!).
